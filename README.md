Hi, Iâ€™m @bennie3211 and I studied mechatronics at Fontys and currently doing my Master in System and Control (S&C) at the TU/e. In addition to studying, I work as a mechanical design engineer and develop new digital microscopes to support and automate biological lab research.

My free time is mostly dedicated to programming in java, python, C, C# and CPP. Currently creating a minecraft plugins that mimic the hungergames style of arena fighting and looking for new types of minigames to create when this one is finished, send me a DM if you want to collaborate on a project!
