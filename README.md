Hi, Iâ€™m @bennie3211 and I've studied mechatronics at Fontys and currently stuyding System and Control (S&C) at the TU/e. Next to the study I'm working as a mechanical design engineer developing new microscope techniques to help and automate biology research.

My free time is mostly dedicated to programming in java, python, C, C# and CPP. Currently creating a minecraft plugins that mimic the hungergames style of arena fighting and looking for new types of minigames to create when this one is finished, send me a DM if you want to collaborate on a project!
